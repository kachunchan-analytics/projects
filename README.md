A collection of my quantitative finance projects, categorized for easier browsing.  ðŸ‘‹

**Introduction:**

Welcome! I'm a quantitative finance professional passionate about applying machine learning, deep learning, and portfolio optimization techniques to solve complex financial problems. My interests span backtesting, machine learning, and portfolio optimization. This repository showcases a selection of my projects developed during my Financial Engineering Degree.


## Projects

This section details my quantitative finance projects, providing descriptions, technologies used, links to the code, and visualizations of key results.


### Stock Price Prediction using Neural Networks

* **Description:** This project predicts stock prices using historical data and a neural network.  Hyperparameter optimization was performed using Grid Search.
* **Technologies:** Python, Scikit-learn, yfinance, TensorFlow/Keras (specify which one was used)
* **Link:** [Project Link](https://github.com/kachunchan-analytics/projects/blob/main/StockPricePrediction_NeuralNetwork.ipynb)
* **Colab Notebook:** [Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Jh78UxSBzGYzFTaW4P1G7Zr4CZcNsiNz?usp=sharing)
* **Key Results:**  ![Stock Price Prediction](Plots/StockPrediciton_NeuralNetwork.png)


### Stock Price Movement Prediction using Convolutional Neural Networks and Gramian Angular Fields (GAF)

* **Description:** This project predicts stock price movements using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Time series data was converted into images using Gramian Angular Fields (GAF) for input to the CNN.
* **Technologies:** Python, GAF, TensorFlow/Keras (specify which one was used), Scikit-learn
* **Link:** [Project Link](https://github.com/kachunchan-analytics/projects/blob/main/ConvolutionalNeuralNetwork_Prediction.ipynb)
* **Colab Notebook:** [Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fXhuSLU_CxPIHiMbELwEuuKoJih2SeQs?usp=sharing)
* **Key Results:**
